This is a simple terminal-based Shopping Cart System written in Python. The program allows users to manage multiple shopping carts, each containing a list of items with their quantities and prices. Users can add new carts, remove existing carts, view all carts and their contents, and modify the items in any cart.

Features
Add Cart: Create a new, empty shopping cart.
Remove Cart: Delete any existing cart by selecting its number.
See List of Carts: View all carts and the items they contain.
Modify a Cart: Add or remove items from any cart.
Show Total: Compute and display:
The total price of all carts combined
The average price per item in each cart
The most expensive cart and its total price
User-Friendly Interface: The terminal is cleared between actions, and dividers are used for a clean, organized display.
Input Validation: Handles invalid inputs gracefully.
If there are no carts, the system will inform the user with a friendly message.

Usage
Run the program in a terminal. Use the menu options to manage your shopping carts and items. All actions are performed through simple prompts.
